The right trigger locks the robot wheels by crossing them. To get out of the crossed state, move either joystick.

## Box Op Controls
The box op controls are on the farm simulator controller. There are two buttons that will be used during the Sacramento Regional:
* The top right orange button labeled `IN`: holding this will deploy the intake
* The bottom right orange button labled `OUT`: holding this will reverse the intake motors and spit out the held piece. 
* Releasing either button will retract the intake and turn off the motors.
