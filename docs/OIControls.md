# OI Controls

## Driver Controls
The driver controls the two joysticks on the left of the driver station. The image below shows the controls.

The left trigger releases the grabber. This will not apply to the Sacramento Regional as we will not be using the grabber.

The right trigger locks the robot wheels by crossing them. To get out of the crossed state, move either joystick.

The side buttons on the right joystick have debug functions as shown in the image that should not need to be used during a match. 
* The left button zeroes the calculated robot position. 
* The right button resets the gyro which tilts the control scheme for the robot. If this button is pressed, right joystick forward will move the robot towards the direction that the intake is facing, and the rest of the controls will map correspondingly. 

## Box Op Controls
The box op controls are on the farm simulator controller. There are two buttons that will be used during the Sacramento Regional:
* The top right orange button labeled `IN`: holding this will deploy the intake
* The bottom right orange button labled `OUT`: holding this will reverse the intake motors and spit out the held piece. 
* Releasing either button will retract the intake and turn off the motors.
