# Autonomous Proceudues
There are three current autonomous procedures that will play at the start of the match during the autonomous phase. 

## OnePieceBalance
This autonomous starts with the robot outtaking to score one piece, and then moves backwards and balances. The robot has to be in line with the charge station.

## OnePieceExitCommunity
This auton starts with the robot outtaking to score one piece, and then moves backwards in order to exit the community. This is only possible when the robot is originally positioned in a spot not blocked by the charge station. It is generally not the best choice for auton, and should only be chosen if an alliance member has one very good auton involving auto balance.

## OnePieceExitCommunityBalance
This auton is similar to the `OnePieceExitCommunity` auton, but adds on the auto balance. It only works if the robot is in line with the charge station, and is the highest scoring auton.
